# Summary
Contained within this repo are 1) a review of the literature identifying papers which have applied the Rota et al. 2016 multi-species occupancy model for interacting species. 2) Simulation study 1. a power analyses exploring the prevelance of type M and type S errors in a series of scenarios examining different sampling regimes and underlying parameter values. 
3) Simulation study 2. a simulation study exploring the impacts of shared responses to habitat covariates on estimating species interactions, 4) Simulation study 3. a simulation study exploring the impact of extra-pair interactions when estimating species interactions from co-occurence data. and 
5) Simulation study 4. a simulation study exploring how indirect interactions between species can arise indirectly.

Below you fill find descriptions of each folder in this repository and files contained within them.

# The folder directory (./scripts/...)

This folder has five subfolders

# 1. The literature review (./scripts/Literature review)

**1. 01_identify_papers_to_include **

This script identifies xx

**2. 02_included_papers_summary_stats **

This script summarizes key parameter values of interest from all the reviewed papers

# 2. Simulation study 1 (./scripts/Simulation study 1)

This file contains all the detection/non-detection data for black bears collected during summer surveys from 2016-2018 in the southern tier of New York State. Each row is a site, each column is an occasion, each cell is a detection/non-detection record
